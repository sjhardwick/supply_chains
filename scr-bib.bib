	abstract = {We explore the role of export subsidies when foreign goods are initially of unknown quality to domestic consumers. Absent export subsidies, entry of high quality firms may be blocked by their inability to sell at prices reflecting their true quality. Export subsidies can break this entry barrier and increase welfare. Moreover, even when high quality firms find it possible to signal their quality to consumers through an introductory pricing strategy, a rolefor government policy can arise: the signal (low introductory price) transfers surplus from foreign producers to domestic consumers and can be avoided with an appropriate export tax/subsidy policy.},

We argue that international externalities, in particular, are essential for explaining a number of empirical regularities about growth and development. Foremost among these is that many countries appear to share a common long run growth rate despite persistently different rates of investment in physical capital, human capital, and research. With this motivation, we construct a hybrid of some prominent growth models that have international knowledge externalities. When calibrated, the hybrid model does a surprisingly good job of generating realistic dispersion of income levels with modest barriers to technology adoption. Human capital and physical capital contribute to income differences both directly (as usual), and indirectly by boosting resources devoted to technology adoption. The model implies that most of income above subsistence is made possible by international diffusion of knowledge.},

It begins by providing a brief history of subsidy disciplines in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and World Trade Organization predating any concerns introduced by China. It then describes contemporary economic problems with China’s approach to subsidies, their impact, and the apparent ineffectiveness of the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures to address them. Finally, it calls for increased efforts to measure and pinpoint the source of the problems—in a manner analogous to how the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development took on agricultural subsidies in the 1980s—before providing a legal-economic assessment of proposals for reforms to notifications, evidence, remedies, enforcement, and the definition of a subsidy.},

In the Arrow-Debreu benchmark, where there is no economic power and political power is seemingly irrelevant, there is no need for trade agreements – free trade is the optimal policy for each country. But under even minimal deviations from that benchmark, trade agreements matter. We focus on environments in which there are market failures, technology is endogenous, and there is political power. Power dynamics play, for instance, a critical role in the design, implementation, and enforcement of agreements, with the latter being a critical difference between international agreements and domestic contracts and a key determinant of the feasibility and consequences of agreements. With endogenous technology, trade rules proscribing industrial policies may lead to lower growth and greater cross-country inequalities. Finally, we develop a framework which may be useful in the design and implementation of trade rules.},

We refer to this set of government interventions as “industrial policy.” We explore the theoretical foundation for industrial policy and then review the related empirical literature. We follow this with a broader look at the empirical work on the relationship between trade and FDI and growth. In this review we find no support for “hard” interventions that distort prices to deal with Marshallian externalities, learning by exporting, and knowledge spillovers from FDI. Nevertheless, we still envision an important role for what we refer to as “soft” industrial policy. The goal is to develop a process whereby government, industry and cluster-level private organizations can collaborate on interventions to increase productivity. We suggest programs and grants to help particular clusters by improving the formation of skilled workers, technology adoption, regulation and infrastructure.},

We discipline the labor supply shock across sectors and countries using the fraction of work in the sector that can be done from home, interacted with the stringency with which countries imposed lockdown measures. One quarter of the total model-implied real GDP decline is due to transmission through global supply chains. However, “renationalization” of global supply chains does not in general make countries more resilient to pandemic-induced contractions in labor supply. This is because eliminating reliance on foreign inputs increases reliance on the domestic inputs, which are also disrupted due to nationwide lockdowns. In fact, trade can insulate a country imposing a stringent lockdown from the pandemic-shock, as its foreign inputs are less disrupted than its domestic ones. Finally, unilateral lifting of the lockdowns in the largest economies can contribute as much as 2.5\% to GDP growth in some of their smaller trade partners.},

	abstract = {Industrial Policy for the Twenty-First Century* Unlike what is commonly believed, the last two decades have not witnessed the twilight of industrial policy. Instead, incentives and subsidies have been refocused on exports and direct foreign investment, in the belief that these activities are the source of significant positive spillovers. The challenge in most developing countries is not to rediscover industrial policy, but to redeploy it in a more effective manner. This paper lays out an institutional framework for accomplishing this objective. A central argument is that the task of industrial policy is as much about eliciting information from the private sector on significant externalities and their remedies as it is about implementing appropriate policies. The right model for industrial policy is not that of an autonomous government applying Pigovian taxes or subsidies, but of strategic collaboration between the private sector and the government with the aim of uncovering where the most significant obstacles to restructuring lie and what type of interventions are most likely to remove them.},

This paper examines the three approaches asking which, if any, makes the most sense. It argues that the detailed rules of the WTO and EU are largely indefensible from an economic perspective. They fail to identify subsidization in any meaningful sense, and lack the capacity to distinguish socially constructive subsidies from those that are “protectionist” or are otherwise objectionable.

	abstract = {Recent supply disruptions catapulted the issue of risk in global supply chains (GSCs) to the top of policy agendas and created the impression that shortages would have been less severe if GSCs had been either shorter and more domestic or more diversified. But is this right? We start our answer by reviewing studies that look at risks to and from GSCs and at how GSCs have recovered from past shocks. We then look at whether GSCs are too risky, starting with business research on how firms approach the cost-resilience trade-off. We propose the risk-versus-reward framework from portfolio theory as a good way to evaluate whether anti-risk policy is justified. We then discuss how exposures to foreign shocks are measured and argue that exposure is higher than direct indicators imply. Finally, we consider the future of GSCs in light of current policy proposals and advancing technology before pointing to the rich menu of topics for future research on the risk-GSC nexus.},

This literature is a significant improvement over the earlier generation of empirical work, which was largely correlational and marred by interpretational problems. On the whole, the recent crop of papers offers a more positive take on industrial policy. We review the standard rationales and critiques of industrial policy and provide a broad overview of new empirical approaches to measurement. We discuss how the recent literature, paying close attention to measurement, causal inference, and economic structure, is offering a nuanced and contextual understanding of the effects of industrial policy. We re-evaluate the East Asian experience with industrial policy in light of recent results. Finally, we conclude by reviewing how industrial policy is being reshaped by a new understanding of governance, a richer set of policy instruments beyond subsidies, and the reality of deindustrialization.},

	abstract = {China has rich solar energy resources with great potential for future development. In recent years, encouraged and guided by China's central and local governments as well as international market, China's PV industry has seen a fast development, with increasingly expanded output. A complete industrial chain has taken shape. In 2011, the PV industry of China saw an annual output value of more than 300 billion RMB and total exports and imports of 142 billion RMB, providing jobs for 300,000 people. The development of China's PV industry mainly relies on the European market. Major factors driving the increase of its production capacity include: huge profits at early stage; great support of governments; lack of effective development planning; low-end processing and manufacturing; low admittance standards. The overcapacity in China's PV industry here refers to overcapacity of PV products such as silicon, polycrystalline silicon, solar cells and PV modules. Impacted by the US Financial Crisis and the European Debt Crisis, the market demand for PV products has been shrinking, resulting in more serious overcapacity of the industry. The Chinese government had hoped that the domestic PV market could absorb the overproduced PV products. However, it seems that, due to insufficient development and uncoordinated incentive system, the domestic PV market may not be able to promote significant change of the situation in a short period. Therefore, it should take a long time to solve the problem of overcapacity.},

	abstract = {Currently, there is much concern about traditional energy transition owing to the exacerbation of various environmental issues. As a highly developed industry in terms of renewable energy, the photovoltaic (PV) industry has played a significant part in achieving the goal of low carbon development. This study examines Chinese-listed PV enterprises from 2014 to 2020 to explore not only the impact of government subsidies on innovation performance but also the moderating effect of carbon trading prices. The results are as follows. First, government subsidies have a promoting effect on innovation performance and R\&D input plays a mediating role on a continued basis. Second, this promoting effect is more pronounced in zones designated for carbon trading pilot. Finally, carbon trading prices exert a positive moderating effect between government subsidies and innovation performance. Therefore, while increasing government subsidies, the state should also create a carbon trading market with more realistic trading prices for PV enterprises and give full play to the price discovery process in the carbon market.},

            Denmark is currently a world leader in the use and market of both onshore and offshore wind energy. This chapter attempts to unravel the role that public policy has played in the Danish wind energy innovation success. This is done by telling four public-policy stories. The first story is about integration of wind energy policy and energy and climate policy, and demonstrates how generations of Danish policymakers have been able to constantly renew and uphold a visionary, political consensus over a very long period of time. The second story focuses on the political battle that has been fought to make wind turbine technology an integral part of the electricity grid. The third story is about the dynamics of the industry politics of wind energy and describes the policy for developing a domestic market as well as for taking advantage of foreign markets. The fourth story involves the precarious planning and siting of wind turbines as part of the broader challenge to obtain and maintain social (national and local) support for wind energy. The principle of local citizen ownership of wind turbines, which had broad political support, played a major role in this. By taking a broad look at the development of Danish wind energy over the past five decades, we get a good picture of the various enabling and regulatory roles that public authorities and policies played in nurturing this widely celebrated successful innovative industry.},
